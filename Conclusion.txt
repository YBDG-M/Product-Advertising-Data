### If we observer coefficients more weight is give for "Affiliate_Marketing" because it explains the variance in product_sold better than other variables. This can be observed in seaborn pairplot as well.

### We could predict test values with a R2_score of 0.9999601568574745 using Linear Regression Model. Higher the R2_score higher the model is able to predict the variance of Product_sold.

➡️ Each dot represents a specific prediction.
➡️ The x-axis shows the SHAP values, which represent the impact of each feature on the model output.
➡️ Features are listed on the y-axis, ordered by their average absolute SHAP values.
➡️ The color of each dot indicates the value of the feature for that prediction (blue for low values, red for high values).

## Interpretation:
➡️ Positive SHAP values (toward the right) indicate a positive impact on the model's prediction of higher product sales.
➡️ Negative SHAP values (toward the left) indicate a negative impact on the prediction of higher product sales.
